# IoT Projects Showcase

Welcome to the IoT Projects Showcase repository! This collection of projects demonstrates the exciting possibilities of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Whether you're a seasoned IoT developer or just starting your journey into the world of connected devices, you'll find inspiration, resources, and working examples here.

## Overview

IoT is revolutionizing the way we interact with the physical world. From smart homes and industrial automation to environmental monitoring and healthcare solutions, IoT offers endless opportunities to create innovative applications.

This repository serves as a hub for a variety of IoT projects that showcase different aspects of IoT technology. Each project provides:

- **Code:** Explore the codebase, including firmware, software, and data processing scripts.
- **Hardware:** Get insights into the required hardware components and wiring diagrams.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation, including project objectives, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- **Demo Videos:** Watch videos demonstrating the project in action.
- **Resources:** Links to helpful resources, libraries, and tutorials related to the project's technology stack.

## Projects

### The Fire Fighting Robot - IoT

Explore an autonomous fire-fighting robot that uses three sensors to detect flames and extinguish them. This project was submitted to Bangalore University under registration number 18NCS85037.

- **Code:** [The Fire Fighting Robot Code](The-Fire-Fighting-Robot-IoT/)
- **Hardware:** See the [block diagram and circuit diagram](The-Fire-Fighting-Robot-IoT/)
- **Documentation:** Find detailed documentation in the project folder.
- **Demo Video:** [Watch the demo](The-Fire-Fighting-Robot-IoT/demo.mp4)

### Keyboard and Mouse Controller - IoT

This program illustrates the use of the Mouse and Keyboard libraries together. Five momentary switches act as directional buttons for your cursor. When a button is pressed, the cursor on your screen will move, and a keypress, corresponding to the letter associated with the direction, will be sent to the computer.

- **Code:** [Keyboard and Mouse Controller Code](Keyboard-and-Mouse-Controller-IoT/)
- **Hardware:** Refer to the project folder for hardware details.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation available in the project folder.
- **Demo Video:** [Watch the demo](Keyboard-and-Mouse-Controller-IoT/demo.mp4)

### Hand Gesture Controlled Robot - IoT

Design a simple Hand Gesture Controlled Robot using Arduino Nano, MPU6050, RF Transmitter-Receiver Pair, and L293D Motor Driver. This robot is controlled by the tilt of the hand.

- **Code:** [Hand Gesture Controlled Robot Code](Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Robot-IoT/)
- **Hardware:** Check the project folder for hardware components and wiring diagrams.
- **Documentation:** Find comprehensive documentation in the project folder.
- **Demo Video:** [Watch the demo](Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Robot-IoT/demo.mp4)
